Hello Player! 
Sorry to say this, but you are currently in a survival simulator. 
However, dying here may be the end for you.
We have tried and failed to rewire the test engine of 
this system and it is now in control of all the rewards and consequences. 

Luckily, our lead Virtual Reality programmer,
 Chromei was able to program a quick script for us to be able to contact you.
 The Virtual Reality the system has placed you in scenario you are in now is this:
 You’ve been placed in a world where a devastating 
 ritual done at certain time each year by the local citizen of Berlock, 
 to clean “Hatred” from their hearts.
 At the end of each ritual the government provide clean up and service for the streets.
 This includes: Picking up the dead bodies;
  wash the blood from the street; 
 patch up any looted stores.
 Chromei is programming weapons for 
 you since you won’t be able to get out the house…
 She is a decent programmer she will help you get
  stronger but you need things right now, 
 and she can only make simple things as fast as 
 possible…until we get u the fuck out of this system!
